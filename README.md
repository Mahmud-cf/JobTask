Abu Taher's bhai gave me the task to do three projects. Here are the code, live links, and videos are available for all three projects.

Project 1: Background Animation
    The first project involved a simple background animation done with CSS and JavaScript.

Project 2: Syntax Highlighter
    The second project is a syntax highlighter. Here If you select any text, a border will appear around that text. I used React JS here along with React-Syntax-Highlighter.

Project 3: Card Animation
    Project number three here is a card animation and background animation. For background animation, I used Konva JS and for card animation I used vanilla-tilt.
